Before we start, make sure you have these things installed:
Python, preferably the latest version (Downloadable from the Microsoft Store, 3.12 is the latest at the time o
Pygame, of which you can download by saying 'pip install pygame' in your terminal (AFTER YOU HAVE INSTALLED PYTHON) 
And some kind of code editor/notepad.
You can have the launcher for the LTHos Terminal on your desktop, but make sure the other files are safe, and make sure it's a shortcut.

 
                                                     
                                                     
                                                     
Making sure all of the dependencies are installed, open the folder called 'Scripts'. open a new tab in File Explorer and get back to the LTHos Terminal folder, and right-click on the 'Terminal Launcher.bat' and open it with notepad

                                                       
                                                       
Once you have 'Terminal Launcher.bat' open in notepad, navigate to where it says 'cd "  " '. Go back to the tab of 'Scripts' and click on the bar at the top, it says something like '> Desktop > LTHos Terminal > Scripts'. Click on it. It should now be highlighted and look like 'C:\Users\######\Desktop\LTHos Terminal\Scripts'. Make sure to copy that and go back to the code editor with 'Terminal Launcher' open, and paste the 'C:\Users\######\Desktop\LTHos Terminal\Scripts' in between the "" and click CTRl+S to save it and you should be all good to go.


                                                       
                                                       
                                                       
Make sure that it's working correctly, if it's not, you may have installed it wrong. This is a project I've spent a little bit of time on and it isn't that good, but it works pretty well as a little game engine and stuff. I'm going to try and improve it and if you think it needs something extra, let me know or even modify your own and upload that! Make sure to credit me though. Thats all I have!
